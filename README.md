# official-portfolio

First portfolio project.
Purpose of this is to demonstrate my skills as a developer.

Personal requirements
-Looking for modernized styled webpage fully responsive with new widgets without being obnoxiously overboard and too flashy.
-Must flow nicely in both context as well as design (will log rough draft of layout)
-Accesibility, page should be viewable and easy to navigate through.
-Contact me section quick painless.. somehow make it fun? So they want to meet you duh..
-Showcase all completed projects. Maybe design as a gallery something interactive for the user to browse through and maybe sample?
-End result should leave the user with a joyful and memorable experience.
